# Email-Spam-Detection
In this project we have tried to make a machine learning model that is trained on ham and spam email dataset. It is used to detect spam emails. The model is trained on two datasets for better accuracy so the model have high accuracy to detect mails regarding spam and ham. 
We have used three models that are Decision Tree, Random Forest and Multinomial Naive Bayes. To implement our ML model.
